# Exercises Getting Started with Python

1. [Exercise 1](scripts/exercise_1_1.py)

    Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.

2. [Exercise 2](scripts/exercise_1_2.py)

    Create a Python program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The user should enter the temperature in Fahrenheit, and the program should print the equivalent temperature in Celsius.

# Control Structures and Loops

1. [Exercise 1](scripts/exercise_2_1.py)
    
    Write a Python program that prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using a loop.

2. [Exercise 2](scripts/exercise_2_2.py) 

    Create a Python program that checks if a given number is prime or not. The user should input a number, and the program should print whether it is prime or not.

# Funcitions and Data Types

1. [Exercise 1](scripts/exercise_3_1.py)
    
    Write a Python function called find_maximum that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number from the list.


2. [Exercise 2](scripts/exercise_3_2.py)
    
    Create a Python function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

# Advanced Python Concepts

1. [Exercise 1](scripts/exercise_4_1.py)

    Write a Python class called BankAccount with methods for depositing, withdrawing,and checking the account balance.


2. [Exercise 2](scripts/exercise_4_2.py)

    Create a Python program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word using a dictionary. The program should print the words and their counts.
# Python Programming Best Practices

1. [Exercise 1](scripts/test_exercise_5_1.py)

    Write a Python function called is_palindrome that checks if a given word is a palindrome. The function should have proper error handling and be tested with unittest.


2. [Exercise 2](scripts/exercise_5_2.py)

    Create a Python decorator called timer that measures the time taken to execute a function. Use this decorator on a function that sorts a list of random numbers and prints the sorted list.
